# calmweb

A proxy / Web filter aimed to protect eldry or unconfident people on the internet, protecting them from ads, scams and block remote control softwares like Teamviewer.

Why use Camlweb?
Calmweb is meant to protect people with no or poor internet knowledge.  
It's aggressive by design, simple yet efficient ( i hope)
It works system wide, so no matter the browser you use, it will work.

- Ensure the proxy will not cause problms: correct stop at shutdown, multi users
- Displaylig log crash the program
- Enhanced a lot the script, make it perfectly stable and robust.
- Correct encoding (some messages are displayer weirdly)
- Configure a self-updating method
- Allow to setup a system wide, "discrete" mode where the program runs  in background showing no icons at all
- Add domains in whitelist that are needed
